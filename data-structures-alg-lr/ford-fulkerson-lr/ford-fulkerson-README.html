<h3>Ford Fulkerson</h3>

Ford Fulkerson is a greedy algorithm used to calculate max netowrk flow. This algorithm works by searching for augmenting paths, or a path from the source to the sink (end). It then determines how much flow can be sent through a path, and then increases the flow by the minimum residual capacity.
