### Red-Black Trees
Red-Black Trees (RBTs) are a type of binary tree which assign each node with either red or black. RBTs follow some rules to ensure it is self balancing. The root of an RBT is always black, and red nodes cannot have red children. RBTs are known for fast storage and retrieval, making them a very efficient binary tree structure.
